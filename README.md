# üß† DanielGeek's Rust & AI Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Rust and AI development projects. This repository showcases my journey through systems programming with Rust, blockchain development, backend architecture, and cutting-edge AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs), agents, and embeddings.

Each project folder is numbered for organization and represents a focused effort to explore a specific technology, concept, or real-world problem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Highlights

- **Rust**: Systems programming, gRPC, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, clean architecture, blockchain, and high-performance APIs.
- **Solana**: Anchor framework and zero-copy accounts.
- **AI & LLMs**: Agents, embeddings, vector search (Qdrant), multi-agent orchestration, and OpenAI/Ollama integrations.
- **DevOps**: Docker (slim builds), Kubernetes deployments.
- **Web Backends**: Axum, Tonic, GraphQL, CRUD APIs.
- **Concurrency**: Tokio async runtime examples.
