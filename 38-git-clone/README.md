This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Git" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/git).

In this challenge, you'll build a small Git implementation that's capable of
initializing a repository, creating commits and cloning a public repository.
Along the way we'll learn about the `.git` directory, Git objects (blobs,
commits, trees etc.), Git's transfer protocols and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your Git implementation is in `src/main.rs`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.87)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Git implementation, which is implemented
   in `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be
   slow the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Testing locally

The `your_program.sh` script is expected to operate on the `.git` folder inside
the current working directory. If you're running this inside the root of this
repository, you might end up accidentally damaging your repository's `.git`
folder.

We suggest executing `your_program.sh` in a different folder when testing
locally. For example:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/testing && cd /tmp/testing
/path/to/your/repo/your_program.sh init
```

To make this easier to type out, you could add a
[shell alias](https://shapeshed.com/unix-alias/):

```sh
alias mygit=/path/to/your/repo/your_program.sh

mkdir -p /tmp/testing && cd /tmp/testing
mygit init
```

## Commands

### hash-object

```sh
cargo run hash-object -w test
```

This will create a blob object in the `.git/objects` directory.

The output will be the SHA-1 hash of the file.

```sh
83bd3630bb4c88996874d2a2ae693cc615d7fcd5
```

This is the SHA-1 hash of the file.

```sh
ls .git/objects/83
```

This will show the blob object in the `.git/objects` directory.

```sh
83bd3630bb4c88996874d2a2ae693cc615d7fcd5
```
