# Rust test

## Introduction

Implement and benchmark a rust routine that performs the forward and backward Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) over $Z_{Q}[X]/X^N+1$ where $N$ is a power of two and $Q$ is a prime satisfying $Q\equiv 1\mod 2N$.

We will judge the submission by i) performance ii) code readability and iii) documentation.

### Base task

Implement NTT for prime $q \leq 2^{61}$.

As a reference, we've provided a 61 bit prime `0x1fffffffffe00001` and its 2N-th root of unity `0x15eb043c7aa2b01f`, required for NTT, for $N=2^{16}$. Note that it's not necessary to stick with reference values.

To calculate 2N-th root of unity for an arbitrary prime, refer to the following [link](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/63616).

### Bonus 1

Improve performance of the implementation by leveraging CPU specific instructions (e.g. Intel CPUs with AVX2 or AVX512 extensions). It's acceptable to limit bit-width of primes (for ex, to $\lt 61$ or $\lt 51$) if needed.

### Bonus 2

Implement optimised NTT for the Goldilocks prime `0xffffffff00000001` = $2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$. Check this [link](https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/09/01/an-efficient-prime-for-number-theoretic-transforms/) for additional information.
